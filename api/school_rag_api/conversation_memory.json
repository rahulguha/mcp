    "user": "give me a cost comparison between schools",
    "ai": "Unfortunately, the provided contextual information does not directly compare the costs of attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University to other schools. The information focuses on detailing the various costs associated with attending Embry-Riddle, such as tuition, fees, housing, and additional program-specific expenses. \n\nHowever, the context does mention that Embry-Riddle is \"by far one of the most affordable private universities for aviation/aerospace education.\" This suggests that Embry-Riddle's costs may be lower compared to other private universities offering similar degree programs. \n\nTo provide a more comprehensive cost comparison, I would need additional information on the tuition, fees, and overall costs of attending other universities, especially those with aviation/aerospace programs. Without that comparative data, I can only convey that Embry-Riddle positions itself as an affordable option among private institutions in its academic focus areas. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!\n\nSource URLs: \nhttps://daytonabeach.erau.edu/admissions/faq\nhttps://daytonabeach.erau.edu/admissions/estimated-costs"
